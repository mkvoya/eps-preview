# PostScript Preview

> PostScript Preview is an extension that helps to **preview** EPS and PS files in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It supercharges how your view PostScript files by also allowing to **pan** and **zoom** the image. You can also change the preview background for extra **customizations**.

## Features

This extension enables the in-VSCode preview of EPS image files.
A new command `postscript-preview.sidePreview` is added as well as a preview icon in the menu bar when EPS or PS files are open in VSCode.

## Requirements

This extension depends on the `PostScript Language` extension to recognize EPS/PS file.
You can install that [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mxschmitt.postscript) from the VSCode extension store.

This extension also depends on two commands:

- `ps2pdf` - to first convert the EPS/PS file to PDF (the command is part of GhostScript)
- `pdf2svg` - to convert the generated pdf to svg which is shown in the preview

Thus you need to install these two commands first and ensure they are in the executable path.

For **macOS**, you can install them via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install ghostscript
brew install pdf2svg
```


For **Ubuntu**, you can install them using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ghostscript -y
sudo apt-get install pdf2svg -y
```


For **Windows 10**, you need to have GhostScript installed in your system. You can install them via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install). Run the following commands using an administrative shell.

```bash
choco install ghostscript --version 9.55.0 --force -y

set PATH=%PATH%;"C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.55.0\lib";"C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.55.0\bin"

choco install pdf2svg --ignore-checksums -y

refreshenv

set PATH=%PATH%;"C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\pdf2svg\tools\pdf2svg-windows-master\dist-64bits"
```

You should now be able to view the EPS/PS files in the preview.

If you are having issues setting the PATH, you can set it using the GUI instead as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho). The paths that need to be added are:

```bash
C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.55.0\lib
C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.55.0\bin
C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\pdf2svg\tools\pdf2svg-windows-master\dist-64bits
```
